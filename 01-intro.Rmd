# Introduction{#intro}

In this workshop, you will be guided through the processing steps and analysis
of imaging-based spatially resolved transcriptomics (im-SRT) data. The steps
will be demonstrated using CosMx data, however, the steps and code can be
adapted to data generated by other im-SRT technologies. Whilst the concepts
are shared across different platforms, we will refer to differences when
applying the steps on Xenium data.
