Links to various useful resources.

* [Single cell best practicies](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/) : Comprehensive resource on single cell analysis
* [OSCA - (Orchestrating Single Cell Analayis with bioconductor )](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) :  A detailed resource on single cell analyses using the bioconductor ecosystem of packages - still applicable to certain spatial analyses.
* [OSTA (Orchestrating Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis with Bioconductor](https://lmweber.org/OSTA/) : A detailed resource on how to perform spatial analyses using the bioconductor ecosystem of packages. Even if using Seurat, this is a useful resource for detailed explanations of analysis tasks.

* [Voyager Documentaion](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/): A bioconductor package for spatial analyses, centred around [SpatialFeatureExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SpatialFeatureExperiment.html) objects
* [SCverse](https://scverse.org/): An ecosystem for analysing single cell and spatial single cell data with python.



* [Seurat spatial vignette (imaging-based )](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_spatial_vignette_2) : How to load and plot spatial data with seurat - covers different technologies.
* [Spatial Sampler](https://swbioinf.github.io/spatialsnippets/index.html) : Worked examples and code snippets to run various statistical tests on single cell spatial data.
* [Understanding UMAP](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/) : Exploring out UMAP works, and what affects it.
* [Propeller for testing celltype proportion changes](https://github.com/phipsonlab/speckle): The speckle package has tools to test for changes in celltype proportions between groups
